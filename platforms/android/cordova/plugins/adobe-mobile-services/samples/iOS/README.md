**ADBMobileSamples iOS**

This application is being provided by Adobe to demonstrate functionality of the new iOS 4.x Tracking SDK.

The following examples can be found within the app:
* Simple analytics tracking, including using context data
* Using Privacy settings, including user opt-in, opt-out, and unknown
* Timed Actions
* Targeting based on points of interest using trackLocation
* Targeting based on lifecycle metrics and testing special offers
* Media tracking, including segmenting by offsets and milestones
* Lifetime Value tracking

The application supports iOS version 6.1 and newer.

There are three schemes set up in the XCode Project: 
* ADBMobileSamples will send data to a demo report suite controlled by Adobe
* ADBMobileSamples - Dev will send data to a dev report suite controlled by Adobe
* ADBMobileSamples - Bloodhound is configured to send all hits to localhost:50000 so you can easily see your data in Bloodhound
