# ADBMobile details
This component contains Xamarin bindings for the Adobe Mobile Services Android and iOS SDKs. They are fully featured bindings and can use the full feature set of the Adobe Mobile Services SDKs.

The Adobe Mobile Services libraries allow you to capture native app activity (user, usage, behavior, gestures, etc.) and forward that data to Adobe collection servers for use in Analytics reporting. Many of the libraries also include Test&Target mbox capability for A/B and multivariate testing within your mobile app, and audience measurement capabilities through Adobe AudienceManager.

To learn more about the mobile SDKs and to download a product overview data sheet, see [Adobe & mobile solutions](http://www.adobe.com/solutions/digital-analytics/mobile-web-apps-analytics.html).
